## Description
"Fighting 1vs1 Game"  is a fighting game based in Mortal Kombat style game. Players battle each other using punches, kicks, and combos.

## Audio
At the heart of the game's audio is a meticulously crafted soundscape, featuring sounds that were created in Ableton Live using a combination of sound libraries and personal recordings. These sounds were then implemented and mixed in WWise, and C++ was used to trigger audio events in Unreal Engine. As a sound designer, I took great care in ensuring that the audio complemented the game's visuals and gameplay, and that it enhanced the player's overall experience.

## Game development and Middleware
I used Unreal Engine and C++ to create the game mechanics, character movements, health system, damage system, and trigger animations. I also implemented WWise audio events using C++. Minimal use of blueprints was one of my main objectives, as I wanted to demonstrate my proficiency in programming. However, I also recognize the benefits of using blueprints for certain tasks.


## List of softwares and tools used
Unreal Engine,
C++,
WWise,
Ableton Live,
Rider

## Conclusion
As a sound designer, 'Fighting 1vs1 Game' highlights my skills in creating sound assets and implementing them using programming languages. I'm eager to bring my technical expertise, passion for continuous learning, and creativity to a new sound design role. I'm confident that my experience developing this game demonstrates my potential to excel in the industry.
